#### Sequential steps for your learning

        [1] Getting know the ingrediants of deep learning via a single unit neural network for binary classification
            `` use basicDNN_ingrediants.ipynb``
        [2] Setting up 2-layer deep neural network model
            `` use binaryClassification_DNN_2LayerModel.ipynb``
        [3] Keras: build your DNN using Keras with tensorflow backend (observe affect of learning on small and large size datasets)
            `` use binaryClassificationDNN_keras.ipynb``
        [4] Do the same as in [3] with Tensorflow library directly
            `` use binaryClassificationDNN_TF.ipynb``
        [5] Lets begin with Convolution neural network
            `` use cnn_Keras.ipynb``
